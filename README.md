# 🌟 Inspect Rich Documents with Gemini Multimodality and Multimodal RAG – Challenge Lab Solutions

Welcome to the challenge lab walkthrough for **Badge 4** of the [Generative AI Exchange program]([https://www.cloudskillsboost.google](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/981/labs/514650)) by Google Cloud!
This badge, titled **"Inspect Rich Documents with Gemini Multimodality and Multimodal RAG"**, pushed me to apply Gemini AI's powerful multimodal capabilities to analyze rich, complex documents containing images, videos, and text—without any step-by-step instructions.

This repository holds my complete solution notebook (`.ipynb`), which includes detailed markdown notes, code snippets, and explanations documenting how I approached and solved each part of the challenge lab.

## 🚀 About the Challenge Lab

This challenge lab tested my ability to:

- Analyze and interpret multimedia documents combining images, video, and text
- Extract meaningful insights across multiple modalities using Gemini's multimodal prompts
- Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to retrieve relevant information and generate contextual responses
- Build a robust pipeline to process complex multimedia data end-to-end

Unlike guided labs, this challenge demanded creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills to complete all tasks successfully.

## 🧪 Tasks Covered

### 🖼️ **Task 1: Multimodal Understanding of Visual Media**

- Interpreted multiple images with Gemini's multimodal prompt interface
- Compared and contrasted visual elements across images
- Generated detailed summaries and extracted metadata from video content
- Formulated insightful follow-up questions for deeper exploration
- Leveraged Gemini’s context capabilities for enhanced information retrieval

### 📄 **Task 2: Document Intelligence with Multimodal RAG**

- Created comprehensive metadata from mixed-format documents
- Designed natural user queries to trigger information retrieval effectively
- Retrieved, aggregated, and summarized relevant text chunks based on context
- Passed enriched contextual information into Gemini for final inference and response generation

## 🛠️ How I Approached It

- Utilized Python and Gemini’s API extensively for multimodal data understanding
- Built loops and conditionals to systematically process video frames and image sets
- Developed custom query processing and metadata extraction pipelines for RAG
- Engaged in iterative debugging and prompt tuning to improve output quality
- Annotated each step thoroughly with markdown to ensure clarity and educational value
